# CPP_Basics_Advanced

Welcome to the CPP_Basics_Advanced repository! This repository is designed to help new programmers understand the fundamental concepts of C++ programming. It currently covers the following topics:

1. **Variables**
   - [1_variables.cpp](1_variables.cpp): Explains the basics of variables in C++ and their usage.

2. **Arrays**
   - [2_arrays.cpp](2_arrays.cpp): Covers the usage of arrays in C++, including declaring, initializing, and accessing elements.

3. **Pointers**
   - [3_pointers.cpp](3_pointers.cpp): Provides an introduction to pointers in C++ and how they can be used to work with memory addresses.

## Upcoming Topics

- **Structures**: An introduction to C++ structures and how they are used to group related data.

- **Loops**: Explanation of loop structures in C++, including `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

- **Conditional Statements**: Understanding conditional statements like `if`, `else if`, and `switch` in C++.
